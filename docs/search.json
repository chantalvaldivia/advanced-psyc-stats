    "text": "Assignment requirements:\n\nIf you are using Github (recommended), make sure to commit and push your work to GitHub regularly, at least after each exercise. Write short and informative commit messages, and share the link to your assignment with me. If not, you can also send me the rmd & rendered file via Canvas.\nIn this assignment, you will not need to code from scratch. Rather, you’ll need to fill in code where needed. This assignment has a logisitic regression implementation for a scenario from EDA down to model comparison (and would be useful for whenever you may encounter such a situation in the future).\nI want the assignments to begin reflecting a bit more of how you’d be doing things on your own, where you have some prior knowledge and you figure other things out (by referring to documentation, etc.) . In addition to the rmd, I also want you to submit to me notes of anything new that you learn while finishing the assignment. And any pain-points, and we’ll discuss more.\n\nIn general I struggled with this assignment due to the length and just being unclear on some of the points (like what a question was asking) but otherwise I liked this new format of assignment where there were chances to verify your work and repeat some of the same skills.\nI like anything where we build with ggplot\nMaybe some more hints throughout could be helpful?\n\n\nNote:\n\nIf you are fitting a model, display the model output in a neatly formatted table. (The gt tidy and kable functions can help!). Modelsummary also looks good(https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/articles/modelsummary.html)\nMake sure that your plots are clearly labeled – for all axes, titles, etc."

In addition to collecting demographic information, the survey includes questions used to gauge attitudes about government spending priorities, confidence in institutions, lifestyle, and many other topics. A full description of the survey may be found here.\nThe data for this lab are from the 2016 General Social Survey. The original data set contains 2867 observations and 935 variables. We will use and abbreviated data set that includes the following variables:\nnatmass: Respondent’s answer to the following prompt:\n“We are faced with many problems in this country, none of which can be solved easily or inexpensively. I’m going to name some of these problems, and for each one I’d like you to tell me whether you think we’re spending too much money on it, too little money, or about the right amount…are we spending too much, too little, or about the right amount on mass transportation?”\nage: Age in years.\nsex: Sex recorded as male or female\nsei10: Socioeconomic index from 0 to 100\nregion: Region where interview took place\npolviews: Respondent’s answer to the following prompt:\n“We hear a lot of talk these days about liberals and conservatives. I’m going to show you a seven-point scale on which the political views that people might hold are arranged from extremely liberal - point 1 - to extremely conservative - point 7. Where would you place yourself on this scale?”\nThe data are in gss2016.csv in the data folder."
